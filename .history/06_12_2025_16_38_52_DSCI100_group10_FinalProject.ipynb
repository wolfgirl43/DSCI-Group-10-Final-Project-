    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected from a study done by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), a computer science research group led by Dr. Frank Wood. Their current project involves the creation of an embodied AI model that can receive, understand, and respond to a complex environment, similar to how humans interact with the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the popular game \"Minecraft\" was chosen as the \"complex environment\". Behavioural data, such as locations visited, what players said in chat, in-game actions, etc., were taken from players of the \"PLAIcraft\" server, a free Minecraft server run by PLAI, in order to study the trends and patterns of how players interact with the virtual world. This data will then be used to train and develop the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from the players.csv dataset was retrieved primarily during the signup process of each player, with the rest coming from their actual play in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to answer the question of which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that these players can be targeted during recruiting efforts. This led to the question: **Can a player's age, experience, subscription status, and gender be used to determine a player's total number of hours?**\n",

    "### Possible Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the players.csv dataset, there are a few issues. These include `NA` values in the `Age` column, as well as the `gender` and `experience` values being categorical variables. To fix the former, simple data wrangling, removing `NA` values from age, would be beneficial. The latter issue requires a bit more involvement; the use of \"dummy variables\" seems like a valid option in order to predict numerical values from categorical variables. Additionally, there is a lot of players who did not play at all, which may skew the data towards values closer to 0."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine if the player's age, experience level, subscription status, and gender can be used to predict the number of hours they play, and thus the amount of data they will provide to the research, we will first explore the relationships of each of the variables with played_hours via visualisation to see what characteristics are correlated to high playtimes and their individual relavance. In addition, a forward selection of a knn regression model will be done to quantify the relevance via the RMSE value. The RMSE value will then be compared to the mean `played_hours` value to determine whether or not age, experience level, and subscription status can predict played_hours well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this method appropriate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method would be appropriate as it is an exploratory type of question. This form of question investigates possible relationships within a dataset. An example of this would be to determine if the size, shape, colour, etc., of a tumour is relevant to the type of cancer it came from. Regarding answering the exact question stated previously, exploratory visualization will allow the finding of trends and patterns within the data, as well as showing visual relevance. While the forward selection can give us the validity of said patterns seen in the exploratory visualizations. Which can be compared to form a final conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of this method is the small size of the dataset causing forward selection to give poor results, as the repeated training of models on the same dataset increases the likelihood of running into a high cross-validation accuracy/RMSE estimate with a low true accuracy/RMSE estimate on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to compare and select the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have learned knn and linear regression as classification techniques/models. Linear regression is used to predict values from a known linear relationship; meanwhile, knn is used to predict values with a non-linear relationship. In this case, the `hours_played` and the associated predictor variables all lack a linear relationship; thus, knn regression will be selected for use in the forward selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross-validation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will first be split into training and testing sets with a 75-25 split, as the dataset only contains 196 observations. The model will be made or trained using the training sets. Within the training sets, cross-validation will be used with a 5-fold cross-validation as the smaller dataset to lower the variance in RMSE estimates."

    "\n",
    "* Fig. 4.1.1 (`played_hours` and `Age`) we can conclude, due to the peaks and significant changes in the number of hours played at different ages, that the age of a player **is** relavant to predicting the number of hours they may play.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fig. 4.1.2 (`played_hours` and `gender`) we can conclude, due to the peaks seen in the visualisation showing significant changes in the number of hours played depending on the player's gender (Male, Female, Non-binary, Two-Spirited, Prefer not to say, Other, Agender), that the declared gender of a player **is** relavant to predicting the number of hours they may play.\n",

    "* Fig. 4.1.3 (`played_hours` and `experience`) we can conclude, due to the peaks and significant changes in the number of hours played depending on the player's experience level (pro, veteran, regular, amateur, and beginner), that the experience of a player **is** relavant to predicting the number of hours they may play.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fig. 4.1.4 (`played_hours` and `subscribe`) we can conclude, due to the peaks seen in the visualisation showing significant changes in the number of hours played, that whether or not a player is subscribed to a game-related news letter **is** relavant to predicting the number of hours they may play.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> In **Step 4.2** forward selection was used with the same goal as the visualisations in **Step 4.1**. The relavant rmse values were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "| Size | Predictor Combination | rmse |\n",
    "|------|-----------------------|------|\n",
    "| 1\t| played_hours ~ experience\t| 15.15036 |\n",
    "| 2\t| played_hours ~ experience+subscribe |\t15.14435 |\n",
    "| 3\t| played_hours ~ experience+subscribe+gender | 16.43838 |\n",
    "| 4\t| played_hours ~ experience+subscribe+gender+Age | 18.05425 |\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Forward selection works by choosing a starting predictor, recording the rmse value, then adding another, recording the rmse value, then repeating this until all predictors are accounted for. Knowing this, we can infer that a increase in rmse resulted in poorer accuracy thus making the predictor irrelvant.<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Using this knowledge and the table above, we can find that `experience` and `subscribe` are relavant, lowering rmse upon their addition. On the contrary, `Age` and `gender` seem to increase rmse and are thus irrelvant. <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> We are now getting contradictory information between the two methods of determining predictor relevance, which one is better representing the true relavancy of the predictors?<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> It is most likely the visualisations seen in **Step 4.1**. This is because, as stated previously, forward selection requires a large data set in order to avoid increased chance of randomly getting a model with a high cross validation accuracy/rmse and low true accuracy/rmse which will skew the resultant values. However players_csv is already a small dataset with only 196 observations increasing the likelihood that the problem stated before occurs, this is also further exascerbated by the use of training sets which decreased the size of the players_csv dataset even more.<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> These results were mot expected from the forward selection as the visualisations showed significant relevancy for each possible predictor <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Returning to the original question of if a players age, experience, subscription status, and gender be used to determine a players total number of hours? The answer is yes, all variables have some relevancy in determining the hours they may play.<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Further ideas for this exploratory analysis include, attempting the forward selection again in attempts to confirm the findings seen in the visualisations, and using the information regarding the relavancy of predictors to do predictive work on what players should be tragetted for recruitment."
