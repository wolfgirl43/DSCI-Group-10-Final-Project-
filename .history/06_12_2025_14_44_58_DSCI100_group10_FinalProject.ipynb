    "# Introduction #\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected from a study done by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), a computer science research group led by Dr. Frank Wood. Their current project involves the creation of an embodied AI model can receive, understand, and respond to a complex environment, similar to how humans interact with the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the popular game: \"Minecraft\" was chosen as the \"complex environment\". Behavioural data, such as locations visited, what players said in chat, in game actions, etc. were taken from players of the \"PLAIcraft\" server, a free Minecraft server run by PLAI, in order to study the trends and patterns of how players interact with the virtual world. This data will then be used to train and develop the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from the players.csv dataset was retrieved primarily during the signup process of each player with the rest coming from their actual play in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to answer the question on which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that these players can be targeted during recruiting efforts. This lead to the question: **can a players age, experience, subscription status, and gender be used to determine a players total number of hours?**\n",

    "### Possible Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the players.csv dataset there are few issues. These include `NA` values in the `Age` column as well as the `gender` and `experience` values being categorical variables. To fix the former, simple data wrangling removing `NA` values out of age would be beneficial. The latter issue requires a bit more involvement, the use of \"dummy variables\" seems like a valid option in order to predict numerical values off of categorical variables. Additionally, there is alot of players who did not play at all , this may skew the data towards values closer to 0."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine if the player's age, experience level, subscription status, and gender can be used to predict the number of hours they play, and thus the amount of data they will provide to the research, we will first explore the relationships of each of the variables with played_hours via visualisation to see what characteristics are correlated to high playtimes and their individual relavance. In addition a foward selection of a knn regression model will be done to quantify the relavancy via rmse value. The rmse value will then be compared to the mean `played_hours` value to determine whether or not age, experience level, and subscription status can predict played_hours well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this method appropriate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method would be appropriate as it is a exploratory type of question. This form of question investigates possible relationships within a dataset. An example of this would be to determine if the size, shape, colour, etc. Of a tumor is relevant to the type of cancer it came from. In regards to answering the exact question stated previously, exploratory visualisation will allow the finding of trends and patterns within the data as well as showing visual relavancy. While the forward selection can give us the validity of said patterns seen in the exploratory visualisations. Which can be compared to form a final conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of this method is the small size of the dataset causing forward selection to give poor results, as the repeated training of models on the same dataset increases the likelihood of running into a high cross-validation accuracy/rmse estimate with a low true accuracy/rmse estimate on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to compare and select the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have learned knn and linear regression as classification techniques/models. Linear regression is used to predict values from a known linear relationship, meanwhile knn is used to predict values with a non-linear relationship. In this case the `hours_played` and the associated predictor variables all lack a linear relationship thus knn regression will be selected for use in the forward selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be first split into training and testing sets with a 75-25 split as the dataset only contains 196 observations. The model will be made or trained using the training sets. Within the training sets, cross validation will be used with a 5 folds as the smaller dataset to lower variance in rmse estimates."
