    "\n",
    "### Background Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was collected from a study done by the Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI), a computer science research group led by Dr. Frank Wood. Their current project involves the creation of an embodied AI model that can receive, understand, and respond to a complex environment, similar to how humans interact with the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, the popular game \"Minecraft\" was chosen as the \"complex environment\". Behavioural data, such as locations visited, what players said in chat, in-game actions, etc., were taken from players of the \"PLAIcraft\" server, a free Minecraft server run by PLAI, in order to study the trends and patterns of how players interact with the virtual world. This data will then be used to train and develop the AI model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from the players.csv dataset was retrieved primarily during the signup process of each player, with the rest coming from their actual play in the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to answer the question of which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that these players can be targeted during recruiting efforts. This led to the question: **Can a player's age, experience, subscription status, and gender be used to determine a player's total number of hours?**\n",

    "### Possible Issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the players.csv dataset, there are a few issues. These include `NA` values in the `Age` column, as well as the `gender`, `experience`, and `subscribe` values being categorical variables. To fix the former simple data wrangling, removing `NA` values from age, would be beneficial. The latter issue requires a bit more involvement; the use of \"dummy variables\" seems like a valid option in order to predict numerical values from categorical data. Additionally, there are a lot of players who did not play at all, which may skew the data towards values closer to 0. The lack of data may also be an issue as a smaller dataset may cause certain models to be less effective."

    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine if the player's age, experience level, subscription status, and gender can be used to predict the number of hours they play, and thus the amount of data they will provide to the research, we will first explore the relationships of each of the variables with `played_hours` via visualisation to see what characteristics are correlated to high playtimes and their individual relevance. Then a forward selection of a knn regression model will be done to quantify the relevancy of each predictor via rmse value. Lastly, a knn regression model will be made to determine the overall strength of the predictors within a predictive model. The information from all 3 will then be analysed to determine the ability of `age`, `experience`, `subscribe`, and `gender` in predicting `played_hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this method appropriate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This method would be appropriate as it is an exploratory type of question. This form of question investigates possible relationships within a dataset. An example of this would be to determine if the size, shape, colour, etc. Of a tumor is relevant to the type of cancer it came from. In regards to answering the exact question stated previously, exploratory visualisation will allow the finding of trends and patterns within the data as well as providing visual relevancy of each predictor. While the forward selection can help quantify said patterns seen in the exploratory visualisations, and finally the knn regression will determine the overall effectiveness of the predictors in a final model. Which can all be compared to form a final conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main limitation of this method is the small size of the dataset causing forward selection to give poor results, as the repeated training of models on the same dataset increases the likelihood of running into a high cross-validation accuracy/RMSE estimate with a low true accuracy/RMSE value on the test data. Another issue is the need for high intensity and relatively even distribution when doing any form of regression. This is because data points which are considered outliers can play a heavy effect on the final prediction of a new point. For example, if a new player enters their age as 60, classification of them would be based on all other players who are around 60. What happens if there is only one previous 60 year old player and the rest of the dataset contains players 10 years old or under? The model will then base its prediction off of this very limited data making that prediction’s accuracy very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to compare and select the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have learned knn and linear regression as possible regression techniques/models. Linear regression is used to predict values from a known linear relationship, meanwhile knn is used to predict values with a non-linear relationship. In this case the `hours_played` and the associated predictor variables all lack a linear relationship thus knn regression will be selected for use in the forward selection and the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to process the data to apply the model? For example: Are you splitting the data? How? How many splits? What proportions will you use for the splits? At what stage will you split? Will there be a validation set? Will you use cross validation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be first split into training and testing sets with a 75-25 split as the dataset only contains 196 observations. The model will be made or trained using the training sets. Splits will be done prior to creating the forward selection and knn regression model as standard for creating any form of model. Visualisations of predictor and `played_hours` relationships will be done on the entire dataset. Within the training sets, cross validation will be used to determine the rmse and best k values, with 5 folds to minimise variance in RMSE values within the smaller dataset."

    "* Fig. 4.1.4 (`played_hours` and `subscribe`) we can conclude, due to the peaks seen in the visualisation showing significant changes in the number of hours played, that whether or not a player is subscribed to a game-related news letter **is** relevant to predicting the number of hours they may play.\n",

    "<pr> In **Step 4.2** forward selection was used with the same goal as the visualisations in **Step 4.1**. The relevant RMSE values were as follows (exact values may change from each cycle of the forward selection thus important to note the trends rather than the exact RMSE value):\n",

    "<pr> Forward selection works by choosing a starting predictor, recording the RMSE value, then adding another, recording the RMSE value, then repeating this until all predictors are accounted for. Knowing this, we can infer that a increase in RMSE resulted in poorer accuracy thus making the predictor irrelvant.<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Using this knowledge and the table above, we can find that `experience` and `subscribe` are relevant, lowering RMSE upon their addition. On the contrary, `Age` and `gender` seem to increase RMSE and are thus irrelevant. <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> We are now getting contradictory information between the two methods of determining predictor relevance. Thus poses the question: which one is better representing the true relevancy of the predictors?<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> It is most likely the visualisations seen in **Step 4.1** are a better representation of the predictor's relevancy. This is because, as stated previously, forward selection requires a large data set in order to avoid an increased chance of randomly getting a model with a high cross validation accuracy/RMSE and low true accuracy/RMSE which will skew the resultant values. However players_csv is already a small dataset with only 196 observations increasing the likelihood that the problem stated before occurs, this is also further exacerbated by the use of training sets which decreased the size of the players_csv dataset even more.<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Knowing this, the final predictive model in **Step 4.3** will use all possible predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> In **Step 4.3** Predictors were placed in a multivariable knn regression model in order to find their overall efficacy. From this the standard deviation and RMSE were found: <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "| RMSE (mean) | Standard Deviation (SD) |\n",
    "|----------|---------|\n",
    "| 19.04236 | 9.601037 |\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> The above shows that the model is not very effective. This is due to the RMSE value being very far off the median value (0.1 hours) and being about double the standard deviation (1.983x)<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> From this analysis, we can conclude that although `Age`, `experience`, `gender`, and `subscribe` are **relevant** predictors, they are not **effective** predictors when trying to determine `played_hours`. <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> This lack of efficacy can be attributed to a few factors, the main one being the amount of outliers and the distribution of data. Because there is an abundance of players who did not play at all (`played_hours = 0`) the data is strongly skewed towards 0. This is a weakness of knn regression as stated previously in the **Methods** section as it causes more data points to become outliers lowering the overall efficacy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> In conclusion, **the age of a player (`Age`), their experience level (`experience`), gender (`gender`), and whether or not they are subscribed to a gaming newsletter (`subscribe`) are statistically relevant to the number of hours they play (`played_hours`), but are predictively useless in this dataset.**<pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> This was as expected, as clear trends were seen between different predictors and `played_hours` but the overall distribution of the data being so poor was predicted to cause errors or reduce the overall efficacy of predictive models. <pr>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pr> Going forward, similar predictive models should account for players who did not contribute any data (i.e removing them) as well as use a larger dataset. The former would prevent the \"overwhelming\" of `Age`, `experience`, `gender`, and `subscribe` as predictors, and the larger dataset will allow the forward selection to be more effective. This overall will improve the model and provide more insight in the types of players that should be prioritised in recruitment."
